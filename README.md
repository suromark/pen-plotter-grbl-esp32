# pen-plotter-grbl-esp32

I built a simple CoreXY pen plotter that originally used GRBL on an Arduino UNO but now runs on Bart Dringâ€™s awesome GRBL-ESP32 port ( https://github.com/bdring/Grbl_Esp32/ ). This repository contains customized files related to my pen plotter, like the configuration and the KiCAD schematics for the control board that I made.
